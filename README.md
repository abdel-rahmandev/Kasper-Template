# Kasper: HTML & CSS Template Two
- This project coded with only HTML & CSS for practice, The PSD file from [GraphBerry](https://www.graphberry.com/) and it's called [Kapser Template](https://www.graphberry.com/item/kasper-one-page-psd-template).
- I created the project after watched its [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAy1l-2A21ng3gxEyocruT0t) on [Elzero Web School](https://www.youtube.com/c/ElzeroInfo/) Channel.
- The project's target is to try to use every skill that I learned if possible and make improvements on the project's final form.
